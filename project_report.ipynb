    "\n",
    "Our Jupyter notebook introduces a solution: a code designed to extract molecular insights directly from molecule names. This code offers a streamlined approach, enabling users to swiftly obtain crucial details about chemical structure, chirality, and ring composition as well as other key metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook, we highlight the importance, functionality, and uniqueness of our molecular information extraction code. By leveraging its various functions, researchers can accelerate their analyses and deepen their understanding of molecular properties. Furthermore, the visual aid provided by our extension enhances comprehension when working with molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that this code and extension will assist scientific research efforts, providing researchers with tools for comprehending the molecules they work with and extracting further information when examining scientific literature."

    "\n",
    "To extract the SMILES notation from the name of a molecule, the code will utilize the PubChem database, a reliable source known for its vast collection of molecular information. While SMILES notation is commonly used in computational chemistry, it may not be as familiar to chemists who often identify molecules by their names. Therefore, the code prioritizes accepting molecule names as input, including trivial names like \"Curcumin,\" CAS numbers, or systematic names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures user-friendliness and accessibility, catering to chemists who are more accustomed to referring to molecules by their names rather than their SMILES notation. By leveraging the PubChem database, the code guarantees the validity and accuracy of the extracted information, enhancing the reliability of the results obtained.\n",

    "# The importance of Stereochemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial aspect of organic chemistry is stereochemistry, which influences both the effects and chemical properties of molecules. Therefore, having a function that can count, identify, and even attribute chiral centers in a molecule is highly valuable. This functionality has been implemented in the next part of the code, relying on two independent components: one for counting chiral centers and another for printing the R and S configuration of the molecule's image.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that in this code, we opted to attribute the stereogenic centers. This decision was made to optimize space in the final interface of the code, where only one function was deemed necessary. The identification of stereogenic centers was performed in the first function of the code, as demonstrated by the get_compound_info function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in addition to this functionality, the code can identify chiral centers on the molecule image. This last function, shown below, is a feature of RDKit and aids in visualizing chiral centers on the molecule."
