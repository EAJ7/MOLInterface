Repository for charing codes regarding the semester project

## 👨‍🔬 Usage

> This is a program that will take as an input the current clipboard of the user, as long as it is a molecule's name.
> It will give a lot of useful infos about the molecule, like its IUPAC name, SMILES code, atomic formula, the molar mass, and will draw the molecule in 2D in a tkinter window.
> If stereogenic centers are present in the molecule, they will be given with their position and configuration (R,S) and will be displayed on the molecule.
> The chemical groups present in the molecule will also be given, as well as the rings found with their aromaticity.
> A button is also available in order to highlight the chemical groups of the molecule
> A link leading to the PUBchem page of the selected molecule is also available at the bottom of the window.

## 👇👾 Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n MOLInterface python=3.10 
```

```

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on your github.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:(your_github_profile)/(YOUR_REPOSITORY).git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(ch200) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```

### Generate coverage badge

Works after running `tox`

```
(conda_env) $ pip install "genbadge[coverage]"
(conda_env) $ genbadge coverage -i coverage.xml
```
